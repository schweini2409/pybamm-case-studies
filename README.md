# PyBaMM results
Fork in 27th April 2020
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-case-studies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pybamm-team/pybamm-case-studies)

This repository provides a template for generating results (for example, for a paper) using [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)

## Installation

1. Install PyBaMM using a virtual environment: [see instructions in README](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)
1. Activate PyBaMM's virtual environment:
```bash
source path/to/pybamm/env/bin/activate
```

If you want to create the repository once and then forget about it, you can specify a particular PyBaMM version number or commit hash that the repository works with. For example, this repository currently works with PyBaMM commit `53fa5f55e20735dc2e`.

Alternatively, you can set up Travis-CI to notify you if any changes to PyBaMM cause your repository to break, to make sure that your repository stays up to date with the latest improvements in PyBaMM. 

## Making your own repository

1. Make a new repository in your own GitHub account
1. Copy the contents of this repository into this new repository
1. In your copy, edit this README with information about your own paper
1. In your copy, replace files in the `src` folder with files that generate the plots in your paper
1. Either:

    - Set up Travis-CI to run [CRON jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/) to be notified if your repository stops working with the latest version of PyBaMM
    - **or:** Specify (in your README) the PyBaMM version number or commit hash with which your repository works
